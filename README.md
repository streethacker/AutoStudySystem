#Introduction#

>This is a simple auto-study system, which contains 3 core functions: **blog/Q&A/self-assement**. A brief summary of all the tools we have used  are as follows:

>+ **Tornado**

>>The back-end code is written in Tornado, v3.1.0, a non-blocking web framework based on Python.

>>More: [Tornado Docs branch3.1](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/branch3.1/)

 
>+ **MongoDB**

>>Instead of using traditional relation-ship database like Mysql or PostgreSQL, MongoDB, v2.6, one of the most popular NoSQL database, has been applied.
 
>>More: [MongoDB Manual release2.6](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/)

>+ **Motor**

>>An asynchronous Python driver for Tornado and MongoDB, has been used for asynchronous access to the database.

>>More: [Motor Docs branch stable](http://motor.readthedocs.org/en/stable/)   


#Additional Remarks & Special Thanks#
>CHEN is familiar with Python but new to Torndao, it's a great challenge for him to learn Tornado in quite a short time and create this website. He make it!

>LI is also a freshman in fore-end development, but he does really really good job during the whole development period. 

>**Special thanks for LI, we will continue refactoring and make it better.**
